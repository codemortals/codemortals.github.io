            <h3>Hackathons</h3>
            <p>Not just for technologists and programmers, a hackathon is an opportunity for everyone to be creative, bridge the department gap and learn other skills. Why not challenge your skilled teams with their domain knowledge or set their minds to something new.</p>
            <p>Bring together a mix of skill sets and remove the internal politics. Having a hackathon is a great team building exercise, and a way to invite your customers or even your community to join you. We can even provide judges to select the winner of your challenge.</p>
